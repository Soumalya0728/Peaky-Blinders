		<h2>Thomas Shelby</h2>
		Thomas Michael Shelby OBE DCM MM MP is the leader of the Birmingham criminal gang, the Peaky Blinders and the patriarch of the Shelby Family. ... His experiences in World War I left him disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares, and he becomes determined to move his family up in the world.

		<h2>John Shelby</h2>
		John Michael Shelby, also known as Johnny or John Boy, was the third of Shelby siblings and a high ranking member of the Peaky Blinders. He was also a 1/3 shareholder in the Shelby Family business, Shelby Company Limited. He was the husband of Esme Shelby and therefore related to the Lee Family through marriage

		<h2>Ada Shelby</h2>
		Ada Thorne (n√©e Shelby) is the fourth and only female of the Shelby siblings and the only sibling initially not involved with the Peaky Blinders. By the end of 1924, however, Ada assumes a leading position at the United States branch of Shelby Company Limited, dealing only with legal acquisitions; unlike her brothers back home in Birmingham, England.

	<p>
		<h2>Finn Shelby</h2>
		Finn Shelby is the youngest of the Shelby siblings and a member of the Peaky Blinders.

		As he is the youngest of the Shelby's, Finn's involvement within the Peaky Blinders is kept to a minimum, with his brothers Tommy, Arthur, and his Aunt Polly shielding him from the worst of their actions.
